# Plug & Dump
Plug your USB in for few seconds and you are set!
## Description
Have you ever found a suitable target but your time window is not big enough to run an attack?

Well I have a solution for you. Here I will be posting scripts that should help you.

The main goal is to have a service (or series of scripts) that will recognize a type of usb device and run specific attack automatically and headlessly.

## LogitechDump.py
Plug in your Logitech reciever and it will be automatically dumped thanks to @mame82's [munifying](https://github.com/mame82/munifying).

And on top of that if you have his [logitacker](https://github.com/mame82/LOGITacker) plugged in, it will automatically pair with it. So you can have a encrypted backdoor access.

## Keystrokes_to_Duckyscript_analyzer.py
Plug-in BadUSB and capture the keystrokes & get duckyscript!

**Tip:** *Run this script over SSH and plug BadUSB in RPI!*
